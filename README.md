# Peer Review 12
#### A simple project to explore CoreLocation and CLRegion and their Interaction
##### This project is 12/15 Peer Review projects done in the course \"iOS Development for Creative Entrepreneurs\" by UCI.

___

In this application we have a toggle which shows enables/diables showing users location on th MapKitView. There is a iNSPiRE store which has a CLCircularRegion around it. Whenever a user enters that region the application pushes an advertisement as a LocalNotification.

We can even proof this interaction by entering the application and hitting "CheckStatus" UIButton, which will fill the above two *UILabel*s with the CLRegion status and ad.

The application is as shown below.
